# Requirements

In order to test this design on hardware, you will need the following:

* Vivado 2024.1
* Vitis 2024.1
* PetaLinux Tools 2024.1
* Linux PC or Virtual machine (for build)
* 1x [Hailo-8 M.2 AI Acceleration Module](https://hailo.ai/products/ai-accelerators/hailo-8-m2-ai-acceleration-module/)
* One or more [Raspberry Pi Camera Module 2]
* 1x [RPi Camera FMC]
* 1x [FPGA Drive FMC Gen4] (for `zcu106` target design only)
* 1x [M.2 M-key Stack FMC] (for all other designs)
* One DisplayPort monitor supporting 2K (2560 x 1440) resolution
* Alternatively: HDMI monitor supporting 2K resolution and a DP-to-HDMI adapter
* One of the supported carrier boards listed below

## List of supported boards

{% set unique_boards = {} %}
{% for design in data.designs %}
	{% if design.publish %}
	    {% if design.board not in unique_boards %}
	        {% set _ = unique_boards.update({design.board: {"group": design.group, "link": design.link, "connectors": []}}) %}
	    {% endif %}
	    {% if design.connector not in unique_boards[design.board]["connectors"] %}
	    	{% set _ = unique_boards[design.board]["connectors"].append(design.connector) %}

{% for group in data.groups %}
    {% set boards_in_group = [] %}
    {% for name, board in unique_boards.items() %}
        {% if board.group == group.label %}
            {% set _ = boards_in_group.append(board) %}
        {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}

    {% if boards_in_group | length > 0 %}
### {{ group.name }} boards

| Carrier board        | Supported FMC connector(s)    |
|---------------------|--------------|
{% for name,board in unique_boards.items() %}{% if board.group == group.label %}| [{{ name }}]({{ board.link }}) | {% for connector in board.connectors %}{{ connector }} {% endfor %} |
{% endif %}{% endfor %}
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

For list of the target designs showing the number of cameras and M.2 slots supported, refer to the build instructions.

## Supported cameras

The [RPi Camera FMC] is designed to support all cameras with the standard
[15-pin Raspberry Pi camera interface](https://camerafmc.com/docs/rpi-camera-fmc/detailed-description/#camera-connectors),
however these example designs currently only have the software support for the [Raspberry Pi Camera Module 2].

```{tip} We're working on developing software support for more cameras. If you'd like to help with
this effort, your pull requests are more than welcome.
