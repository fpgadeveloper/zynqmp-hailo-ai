# Troubleshooting

## Build failures

Check the following if the project fails to build or generate a bitstream:

1. **Are you using the correct version of Vivado for this version of the repository?**   
   Check the version specified in the Requirements section of the README.md file.

2. **Did you follow the** [build instructions](build_instructions) **?**   
   If it still doesn't build, please let us know and provide details of your setup and the error message(s).
